# Templates for JOSS reviewer invitation and instructions

**Invite new reviewers:**

:wave: @... would you be willing to review this submission for [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/)? Reviews are done entirely through GitHub (issues and pull requests). Please refer to our reviewer guidelines for more information about JOSS and our review process (feel free to ask me any questions as well): https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html

This is a pre-review issue in which I will assign reviewers. Once there are sufficient reviewers (usually 2-3), I will open a new issue where the review will take place. If you agree to review, you will be notified when the review process if formally started.

If you are not able to review at this time, please let me know if you have recommendations for other reviewers. **Please recommend without mentioning a handle to avoid notifying the person** (e.g., you would refer to me as leouieda instead of @leouieda). This way we attempt to reduce the number of people who are subscribed to this thread.


**Review instructions:**

:wave: @... this is the review thread for the paper. All of our communications will happen here from now on.

Both reviewers have checklists at the top of this thread with the JOSS requirements. As you go over the submission, please check any items that you feel have been satisfied. There are also links to the JOSS reviewer guidelines.

The JOSS review is different from most other journals. Our goal is to work with the authors to help them meet our criteria instead of merely passing judgment on the submission. As such, the reviewers are encouraged to submit issues and pull requests on the software repository. When doing so, please mention `openjournals/joss-reviews#REVIEW_NUMBER` so that a link is created to this thread (and I can keep an eye on what is happening). Please also feel free to comment and ask questions on this thread. In my experience, it is better to post comments/questions/suggestions as you come across them instead of waiting until you've reviewed the entire package.

We aim for reviews to be completed within about 4 weeks. Please let me know if any of you require some more time. We can also use @whedon (our bot) to set automatic reminders if you know you'll be away for a known period of time.

Please feel free to ping me here (@leouieda) or email me privately if you have any questions/concerns.
