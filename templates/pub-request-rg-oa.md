Dear XXXXXX,

First of all, thank you for your interest in my work!

I do not upload my work to ResearchGate because it is often illegal to do so since they are a for-profit organization. Furthermore, they have the practice of sometimes inserting an extra page advertising their site into the uploaded PDFs. I find this unacceptable.

I keep copies and download links for all my work on my personal website: https://www.leouieda.com

The article you have requested is open-access (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) and can be freely downloaded from the publisher's website (see DOI link on my website). There you will also find links to related works and other resources like source code, presentations, data, etc.

The paper you have asked for is at: XXXXXX

Best regards,

Leonardo
